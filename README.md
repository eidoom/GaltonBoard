#  Modelling the Invisible #

Software for the Galton board exhibit used for [IPPP](https://www.ippp.dur.ac.uk/) [outreach](https://www.modellinginvisible.org/).
This includes a simulation of a Galton board, which we run on Raspberry Pis.

The exhibit also has a Galton board with light gates to count balls falling in different bins.
The code for this is in the folder `job 7139 galton board counter`.
It is for a Psoc 5lp development board ( CY8KIT-059 ) from Cypress, they come from Farnell/RS.
The software is written in Psoc creator which you can download from Cypressâ€™s website.
There are LEDs with resistors in line to produce light and photo diodes and resistors to produce a pulse when the balls drop past the holes which the Psoc registers via interrupts.
This was developed by [Andrew Hunter](https://www.dur.ac.uk/directory/profile/?id=1730), electrical engineering technician at the Department of Physics, Durham University. 

## Installation

* Install desktop files so the simulation can be accessed by the application menu and from the desktop by running the `install-sim.sh`. 
* Similarly, `install-server.sh` installs desktop files for the server scripts.
* Undo by running the `uninstall-*.sh` scripts.

## Simulation dependancies

* Python 3
  * numpy
  * matplotlib
  * scipy

* python3-tk (system dependancy)
